						The Biotechnician Assistant Credentialing Exam (BACE) is offered by Biotility at The University of Florida’s Center of Excellence for Regenerative Health Biotechnology (UF CERHB). The exam was developed to reflect competencies and skills outlined by the performance and academic standards of Florida’s secondary Industrial Biotechnology Program (#8736000), which are in turn based on Florida’s industry-described requirements necessary for this entry-level position. Students will be issued a Biotechnician Assistant credential from Biotility for successful completion of both the online and practical components of the exam. Schools may use the BACE for the end-of-program validation required by the Career and Professional Education (CAPE) Act.<br><br>
The knowledge exam can be administered by an approved proctor via a computer-based online system.

The BACE program and procedures are covered in this manual. It is critical that that Site Coordinators, Proctors, and Skills Evaluators implement the exam procedures as described to ensure the integrity of the exam and of student outcomes.
