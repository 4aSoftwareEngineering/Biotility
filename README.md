Ok let's make this visible to all now.

_Steps to push to our Github Repository_

Step 1: `git fetch --all` 
 This will update all the branches you've ever checked out with changes that others have made.
 
Step 2: `git pull origin YOUR_BRANCH_HERE` 
 This will pull the _u[dated_ information into your _local_ repository copy.

Step 3: `git add -A` 
 This will mark all of the files you've changed for adding.

Step 4: `git commit -m "YOUR_MESSAGE_HERE"`
 Leave a message giving a short description of what changes you've made.
 
Step 5: `git push origin YOUR_BRANCH_HERE` 
 Finally, push your changes to the branch you're working on.
